## Project Description

Montpelier Zombie Guide is a zombie apocalypse guide for the small town of Montpelier, Vermont. This "guide" is built using React JS and Airtable. There is around 20 guides that are preset by admin. Each guide will be dedicated to a certain subject. Some subject examples are escape routes, food, water, shelter and more. Each guide has its own thread where users can comment and make suggestions. Suggestions with the most upvotes will be appended to the guide every week. Users can also reach out to admin directly and offer suggestions for new guides or new threads.

## SWOT

### Strengths

- I done a fair amount of planning, thinking and note-taking for my idea. I am confident I can pull it off. I've got a better understanding of CSS gird and how to implement it. I feel good about the useState and useEffect as well. I also know how to dig deep and look for knowledge and answers online.

### Weaknesses

- I get confused by the component hierarchy and it is sometimes difficult to vision. Props and state still confuse me. I will definitely seek out help from the instructors if I need to.

### Opportunities

- I have the opportunity to finally come to an understanding of react by building a project. I think I will have a breakthrough when I am actually creating my own app.

### Threats 

- Time. I need to manage my time really well this week in order to learn more about what I am doing and fully implement everything I've learned.
